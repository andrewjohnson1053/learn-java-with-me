# üõ†Ô∏è Java Backend Developer ‚Äî Phase 1 Assignments

Welcome to my Java Core (Phase 1) learning journey! üöÄ  
This repository contains structured assignments covering Core Java concepts needed for backend development.

## üìö Assignment List

### 1. Basics of Java Syntax
- [ ] **1.1** Read 5 integers and calculate sum, average, min, and max.
- [ ] **1.2** Count vowels and consonants in a given string.
- [ ] **1.3** Build a simple calculator using `switch-case` (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- [ ] **2.1** Create a `BankAccount` class with deposit, withdraw, and displayBalance methods.
- [ ] **2.2** Implement Inheritance:
    - Create a base class `Vehicle`.
    - Create derived classes `Car` and `Truck`.
    - Override a method `displayDetails()`.
- [ ] **2.3** Create a `Shape` interface with `calculateArea()` and `calculatePerimeter()` methods and implement it in `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Square`.

### 3. Collections Framework
- [ ] **3.1** Use an `ArrayList` to store and sort names of students.
- [ ] **3.2** Create an `Employee` database using `HashMap` (ID ‚Üí Name) and search functionality.
- [ ] **3.3** Build a simple To-Do list manager using `LinkedList`.

### 4. Exception Handling
- [ ] **4.1** Write a program to safely divide two integers and handle divide-by-zero and input mismatch exceptions.
- [ ] **4.2** Create a custom `InsufficientBalanceException` and throw it in banking operations.

### 5. File I/O
- [ ] **5.1** Create a program to write 5 lines into a text file and read them back.
- [ ] **5.2** Extend the file reader to count total words and characters in the file.

### 6. Java 8+ Features
- [ ] **6.1** Use Lambda expressions to sort a list of integers (ascending and descending).
- [ ] **6.2** Use Streams API to filter names starting with 'A' and display them.
- [ ] **6.3** Use `Optional` to safely fetch and display possibly missing values.

### 7. Multithreading Basics
- [ ] **7.1** Create two threads:
    - First thread prints numbers 1‚Äì5.
    - Second thread prints numbers 6‚Äì10.
    - Implement using `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface.

### 8. Introduction to Design Patterns
- [ ] **8.1** Implement the Singleton design pattern manually.
- [ ] **8.2** Implement a Factory pattern to create different types of Shapes.
